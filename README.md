# Wordle 
A simple and engaging **Word Game** built using **React**!  
In this game, players try to guess a hidden five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the tiles change color to indicate how close your guess is to the actual word:
- üü© Green: Letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
- üü® Yellow: Letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
- ‚¨ú Grey: Letter is not in the word at all.

This project is an attempt to recreate the popular Wordle game using React, offering a fun way to learn React fundamentals like **State Management**, **Props**, **Conditional Rendering**, and **Component Structure**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Learn more about deployment [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This is a one-way operation.  
Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!  
This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you can fully customize them.
